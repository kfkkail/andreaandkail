                </div>
                    <h3>How We Met</h3>
                        <p>Kail needed a substitute for the indoor spring volleyball tournament game; he needed someone to fill in for the final game of the season. A mutual friend contacted Andrea, knowing that she would be more than willing to help out, as she had recently joined the league and was always ready to play! After setting a few balls to Kail, which he so eagerly smashed to the ground, Andrea introduced herself over at “the bench”. The two talked for a while and she quickly learned that his white “patch” was surprisingly not a birthmark and that he wanted her on his team for good. They soon went on their first date and continue to be a dynamic duo on the court. Oh yah, and they did win the tournament that night. :-)</p>
                    <h3>The Engagement</h3>
                        <p>Andrea had to travel for a work event and wanted to spend the weekend before in Nashville, TN. Kail agreed that would be awesome and make for a nice little mini vacation before spending the next week apart. :-( Andrea and Kail had reservations for dinner in downtown Nashville on Saturday night. Before leaving, Kail insisted on bringing the big DSLR camera bag (and tripod, hint, hint) to get a picture of downtown Nashville together. They took the hotel shuttle downtown and started walking around. Kail had the brilliant idea of getting a view of downtown Nashville from the pedestrian bridge overlooking the main skyline. It took a little walking and a little convincing because as soon as they got on the bridge, Kail insisted they get to the other side of the river to find a better spot for the “picture”. After finding THE spot, Andrea got ready for the picture while Kail got the camera setup for a timed photo (he actually started a video). Kail came over while Andrea asked how long it took for the camera to take a picture. He said, “Oh, I don’t know, 10 seconds?”. After waiting, Kail turned towards her and said “Andrea, I love you...” Andrea responded right away “Oh my gosh, what are you doing??” and turned away covering her face. He turned her around, got on one knee, and popped the question. She said YES!!</p>

                <p>Larimar Travels is happy to offer air transportation booking service for the wedding guests when booked at the same time as the accommodations.  Unfortunately, we are not able to service the flight needs of those utilizing mile rewards simply because the airlines will not discuss loyalty redemptions with anyone other than the member. If you have miles that you would like to use, feel free to do so. We are still happy to assist you with the land portion of your trip. You will also qualify for all the wedding group amenities and have access to the private events.
                </p>
                <p>Roundtrip airfare to Cancun from most major cities averages approximately $500 per person. Book early to save money and time!</p>
